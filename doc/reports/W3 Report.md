|:----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------|:------------------|
| Romain Puech         |Frontend (specific)|- [Use entries'dates](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/54) as x-axis for DynamicGraph<br>- [Style modifications](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/53) to DynamicGraph <br>- Created [MascotChat](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/55) class and implemented all basic functionalities of the class. Changed UI accordingly to display the messages in a scrollable area <br>- Implemented [scrollable area](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/21) in the main window to be able to display many entries on the screen, one below the other<br>- fixed various compilation problems <br>- Organised new [tasks](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/64) |-Various fixes in DynamicGraph<br>- Style the Mascot Chat<br>- Conceive new functionalities|
| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (general)|- I [integrated the TextEditor into the EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/48) and [made the difference](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/57) between the readOnly and Editing mode<br>- I also implemented the buttons for switching the modes and saving the updates in the entry<br>- I used the `save_entryperso()` function to [save the updates into a file](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/49)<br>- I added a [mood_slider](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/56) so that the user can add their mood into the entry<br>- I modified the display of friends and activities to represent the actual list of friends and activities from the entry (EntryPerso) <br>|-I still have to make it possible for the user to [modify activities and friends](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/52)<br>|
| Liam Loughman        |Frontend (specific)|Implemented load_habits function which loads presaved habits onto a file and displays them in the mainwindown.||
| Yubo Cai             |Frontend (general)| - Clean some unnesseary function in TextEditor and fixed some bugs and add more functions of it. <br> - Work with Bogdana with on put `TextEditor` class in to the `EntryCard`. <br> - Work with Bogdana on the `EntryCard` class for writing/display mode distinction of the TextEditor| - Clean the useless function and code in `TextEditor` class <br> - Integrate all the components of the mainwindow together <br> - Save styles of the text and display the text with styles in the **Reading** mode.|
| Luigi Massacci       |Frontend (general) |||
| Safaa Arbai          |Frontend (specific) | - Implemented the mascot class. | - Fix the mascot display function and change the style of the chat messages.| 
| Ahmed Benchekroun    |Frontend (specific) |- Learned how to use QVector QDialog and the different functionalitites that I might need. <br> - Implemented the functon that associate adding an activity and clicking to the corresponding button. <br> - Implemented the activities entries and created a vector where the activities added are saved. <br> - Worked with Bogdana in the commit that made it possible for activities to be saved once added. |-Save the activities in a list/vectoof string elements that represents the activities and there corresponding type and save them in a file. <br> - Implement thendifferent functionalities needed for people/friends.|
| Mihaela Gledacheva   |Frontend (general) | - Implemented functions to read the settings from a file <br> - Changed the main window to display n (randomly generated for now) entries and the mood graph corresponding to them <br> - Added option for the user to create a new entry | - Continue synchronizing different components |
| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |- Implemented functions to save and load an "EntryPerso" object in JSON file. Adapted the format of the file for that and designed algorithms to store automatically several objects like activities or friends which are themselves attributes of "EntryPerso" object. (used a string format for this).<br> - changed the implementation of the EntryPerso object to store its attributes Activities and Friends in vectors of pointers instead of simple arrays (so it's more practical for everyone).||
| Junyuan (Frank) Wang |File processing    | - Implement a function to filter a vector of Entry objects. It takes a vector of entries as input and a function and output a vector of pointers of entries. <br> - Implement a function to check whether the entry satisfy the function with numerical attributes. <br> - Change the main GUI for a new widget for filter the vectors showing on the screen. <br> - Create a filter_widget class for signals in GUI| - Finish to implement the signals of the filter widget. <br> - implement the display of the filtered entries on the main window.|
| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Organization of the analysis subteam; we discussed with the rest of the team to find how to change the activities handling inside error class. <br> - Understand the [research paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf) and the properties of STL : robustness to unusual user behaviour, ability to have control over some parameters of the seasonality component, ability to decompose even with missing data. <br> - Start the implementation of STL with the loess protocol. <br> - Research on how to solve weighted least squares quadratic regression in our case.|- Continue working on the STL decomposition. <br> - Work with the rest of the team to test and integrate our analysis on the app prototype.|
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Changed the way we parametrize variables to be analyzed so that both predefined and user-defined activities and parameters can be considered in the analysis. <br> - Modified all methods in data analysis class to work with this new system <br>|- Discuss more ways of analyzing data with the team and implement them|
| Artem Mamichev       |This week I worked on testing the analysis code (function by function) and what results it gives in UI. I am learning NLP machine learning, trying different models and approaches, to implement my own text sentiment analysis (I can't find an appropriate one on the net).  || This week I'm working on ML text sentiment analysis|
