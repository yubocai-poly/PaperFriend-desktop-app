| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (specific)|     -Implemented the [Card](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/17) class and updated its [wiki page](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Card-class) <br> -Started working on the [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/9) class and implemented the display of the "entry date" and "mood".<br>   |   -Continue working on the [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/EntryCard-class)  class.<br>|
| Liam Loughman        |Frontend (specific)|     Had a dificult time getting started on the project since it changed a day before the TD session on Thursday morning, and didn't understand excatly my part.    | Check what my teammates have done so far on the development of the front end.  |
| Yubo Cai             |Frontend (specific)|     This week my task was to work very independently with other members and I completed the implementation of the [TextEditor](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/tree/main/TextEditor). I complete the Design of the UI for the TextEditor and backend function of it. I created two class of `TextEditor` and `Edit` in the program. Now the TextEditor applicaiton can compile successfully and able to achieve the basic functions like edit, change color and font, copy, paste and so on.   |  Next week, as I planed, I will continue to improve the **TextEditor** with more operation like left-justify and right-justify, undo and redo. Also corrent some bugs in the program and build API for the data anlysis team so that they can get data for analysis.  |
| Luigi Massacci       |Frontend (general) | - Helped with the pivoting towards a new project.<br>- Since my laptop decided to abandon me after 7 glorious years, changed my SSD and then did all the unpleasant labour to get my machine back up and running<br>- Got most of the current codebase to compile on Linux, after some messing with CMake  |   - Help the others better leverage the STL and the other features of modern C++ (like ATD)<br> - Begin the integration of the various pieces that have been written so far|
| Safaa Arbai          |Frontend (general) |- Looked for some of the classes needed to implement a user interface.<br>-Wrote the wiki [Classes needed for UI](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Classes-needed-for-UI) page with the classes, a short description and link for more information on them. <br>- I fixed the main window's layout so that the frames would resize according to the window's size. <br>-I followed a youtube series called Qt C++ GUI tutorial for beginners to understand more how Qt designer works.|-I'll work on impementing a button that opens a new window in addition to the close, restore down and minimize buttons.<br> - I'll also discuss with the general front end team what we need to put in our menu bar and work on implementing it. |
| Ahmed Benchekroun    |Frontend (general) |     Created the skeleton of the User Interface by using the different tools and codes available in QT. Documentation about thge different tools that I will need to use to create the user interface. Documentation about the different libraries to learn how the write a code for the user Interface. Managed to make the different layouts in the skeleton size dinamic with respect to the mainwindow size.  |   Find a way to create buttons in the User Interface and learn how to code the different actions that will result in a click of the different buttons that we will need to implement to use the different functionalities of the mood tracker. Learn more how to use the libraries and how to make the User Interface more dynamic and less static. |
| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |-discussion with the analysis team to stay coherent between the saving and analysis of the data.<br> - did a lot of research to understand the structure and how to create a C++ library but also how to test the functions (I opted for the QT framework for the tests) <br> - did research to understand and choose what type of encoding we'll use for our data (I opted for a 64 bit basic encodig with a key).<br> - Implemented the encoding functions and I started to implement the functions to treat our data and save it, (trying to use templates to be able to save any type of entry class). |- Finish the implementation and run some tests to verify that the whole code works<br> - also extend the code to not only the Entry class but to its child classes Entryperso (already started on this with templates). <br> -Write the wiki for the use of those functions|
| Junyuan (Frank) Wang |File processing    |     -Include an AES cipher class which is compatible with QT project. <br> - Implement string to string encryption and decryption cipher function. <br> - Add wiki page.    |   -Continue on the cipher function. Implement it with saving functions and `Entry` Class. <br> - start working on the selection method for `Entry` class files. |
| Mihaela Gledacheva  |Structure          |     - Began implementing the [Entry](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/4) and the [EntryPerso](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/5) classes <br> - Began implementing the [Activity](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/6) class and its [subclasses](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/7) <br> - Implemented an initial version of the [Friend](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/19) class | - Find what other methods and attributes are needed and add them to the classes <br> - Comment the code and write a wiki |
| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Discussed with the File processing team the best way to represent saved user data.<br>- Found what analysis we could do on the user data with the Data analysis team.<br>- Implemented basic function template average_vector and wrote the [wiki](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki) page for the [DayLog](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Day-Log) class.<br>| - Decide with the team who will do which part of the analysis and start working on them.  |
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Created the classes DataAnalysis and MoodAnalysis to give structure to what will be done in the coming weeks and a [wiki page](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Data-Analysis) dedicated to DataAnalysis. <br> - Wrote a simple method "alert_depression" (not functional yet as it uses another unimplemented method).| - Brainstorm some ideas with the team on the details of how the data will be analyzed and start implementing them.|
| Artem Mamichev       |Data analysis      | Proposed a scheme to analyze data and automatically give advice to the user to improve their mood, which we are now implementing with a team. Created Day_Log class which represents a daily information about the user. Implemented anomalies_detection, mean and standart deviatioin functions. | This week: Analysis team will introduce slidebars (e.g. mood, amount of sleep from 0 to 10)! Based on analisys of the everyday track of mood and other values from the slidebars, I will work on making an automatic suggestion to user on how to improve his mood (e.g. 'Try taking more sleep') when our algorythms detect stress or a fall in mood|
