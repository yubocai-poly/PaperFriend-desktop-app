| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend/Fixes |During the holiday, I worked on:<br>- fixing some bugs - issues [#104](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/104), [#105](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/105), [#107](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/107), [#117](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/117)<br>- I added a [Test button](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/103)<br>- I added [emojis](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/110) for activities<br>This week, I: <br>- took on the role of the new frontend subteam leader and distributed some new tasks to the fronted team<br>- worked with "activities and friends": making sure loading and saving works with files, fixed some bugs including issue [#115](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/115)<br>- added [automatic ticks](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/143) for activities and friends that are already a part of the entry<br>|-I have to finish the implementation of [EntryRecap display](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/87)<br>- make EntryCard compatible with all tracked habits and settings - issues [#124](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/124) and [#132](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/132)<br>|
| Liam Loughman        |Frontend       |Added a way to display firstt 6 habits, and when we click on All Habits button, all habits get displayed.

| Ahmed Benchekroun    |Frontend       |- Forced the user to select the type of the activity by implementing a close event function and improving it. <br> - Added a warning when closing "All activities" window so that the activities are saved and that then entries are not misleading. <br> - Started working on people button. <br> - Started looking at and modifying the friendsclass in order to implement people functionalities.|- Implement people functionalities.|

| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing|- Finished the functions to save/load the available activities/friends.<br> - I had an unfortunate issue : after pulling the main branch, the project was building infinitely, and it took me a few hours to find and understand the problem, which fortunately was not hard to fix in the end.<br>- Enjoyed this issue to come back on the file arborescence and modify it, now every file is organized in a corresponding folder.   |- Implement saving and loading functions for the Entry recap objects. Maybe also enhance them.  |

| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis  |- Organization of the data analysis team <br>- Setting up the integration of data analysis with other teams <br>- Rewrote old parts of the code to make them work better, like find_index_sorted. <br>- Fully finished the STL decomposition algorithm with the full inner loop and outer loop.<br>- Debugged all sub-functions and tested that STL gave correct-looking results, chose temporary constants according to [the research paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf). <br>|- Finish with the rest of the team the integration of the analysis in the app. <br>- Test and choose better constants for the application we do of STL. <br>- Replace or improve other analysis functions by using values given by STL. <br>- Optimize the code.<br>|
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis  |- Gave structure to weekly, monthly, and yearly recaps and wrote their first implementations, which focus on analysing metrics defined by us.|- Add to the recaps using analysis from existing functions.<br> - Discuss with the team about methods to analyse user-defined activities and use them to give more detailed recaps.|
| Artem Mamichev       |Data analysis  |- Extended suggestions functionality. Now it check if today is anomalie in some variable and says if it was good or bad; analizes correlations and says which two variables affect MOOD the most; checks if you haven't met your friends for n days. Basing on that it gives suggestions.<br> - Also I'm actively working on implementing python neural network to our c++ project. For now I've chosen this way: I train NN in python -> save it -> from c++ I call python code that executes NN -> write the result into a file -> read the result from a file.| Next week I'll try to finish sentiment analysis implementation and extend suggestions.|
