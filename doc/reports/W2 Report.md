| Romain Puech         |Frontend (specific)|- Organized work and defined tens of clear [tasks](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/64) for everyone for next week<br>-[Restructured the UI](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/8) to use layouts <br>- Improved overall aspect of the [graph](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/10), added animations, proper axis<br>- Made the portion of the curve in the graph [change color when it crosses a certain threshold](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/63). This was more diffcult than expected as QCharts doesn't have any function/interface to do this. I had to superimpose multple curves and compute dummy points based on the slope of the curve to be able to change the color of the portion of the curve at the righ moment even if there is no datapoint placed exactly on the threshold value. Documented these changes.<br>- Coded a function that returns n sample random entries to be able to easely test our functions having an array of entries as a parameter (hidden in the commit "Trying to make the graph change color depending on the mood")|- Implement last [functional](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/54) and [style](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/53) improvements for the DynamicGraph class<br>-[Put all together](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/47) the work that has been done so far to make components "dialogue" between them. Objective: a functioning product by then end of the week.<br>- Implement the 'Mascot' [chat panel](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/55)|
| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (specific)|-Reimplemented Card and EntryCard classes to work with layouts and maintain rounded corners <br>-Modified their display so that the cards are resizable and changed the style a bit <br>-Added a display of "friends and activities" , entry title and text in [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/9))<br> -Made the display of EntryCard adapt to the type of entry (specifically the EntryPerso case) <br>-Updated the [Card](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Card-class) and [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/EntryCard-class) wiki pages<br>|-[Integrate TextEditor to EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/48) <br>-[Integrate the save_to_file function and TextEditor/entry interface](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/49)<br>-[make it possible to add activities and friends into an entry](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/52)<br>-[add mood slider to entry](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/56)<br>-[add writing/display distinction for entryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/57)<br>|
| Liam Loughman        |Frontend (specific)|Found a way to add a few more entry cards in a vertical layout box and add them to frame_5 in order to get a stacked view of the cards.|Fix the issue with the height to fit all cards in the frame and add a scrollable area|
| Yubo Cai             |Frontend (specific)| - Merge the `TextEditor` into the main window, embed TextEditor into MainWindow and realize data intercommunication. <br> - Give data analysis teams a data interface to analyze content through text editors. <br> - Add more functions like `Font`, `Undo`, `Search` and fixed some bugs in the function. More details can be found [here](). <br> - Updated the [TextEditor](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/TextEditor-class) class Wiki page.|- Intercommunication with data teams to engage with proposed data. <br> - Further improvement of some functions in the `TextEditor`. <br> - [Clear all the unnecessary buttons and panels created by the textEditor](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/61) <br> - [add writing/display distinction for entryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/57) <br> - [Integrate the save_to_file function and TextEditor](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/49) <br> - [Integrate TextEditor to EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/48)| 
| Luigi Massacci       |General | - Tried to make the .pro fancier, struggling for now.<br> - Rewrote some bits of code to better leverage the STL (with the MapReduce paradigm) <br> Identified some places where we leak memory.  | - Memory fixes
| Safaa Arbai          |Frontend (general) | - Overrode the exit function of the mainwindow to display a question before exiting. <br> - Implemented full screen window display for the mainwindow and all habits window as the default when opened.  <br> - Added icon to the settings button.| - Implement a class MascotChat to be able to display "Messages" of the mascot.|
| Ahmed Benchekroun    |Frontend (general) | - Implemented screen window that opens when the user clicks on the activities button as a new tab that opens in the user's window. <br> - Ordered the layouts for a friendlier appearance. | - Implement to the interface a way to custom activities and friends. <br> - Load the added activities/friends to a list.|
| Mihaela Gledacheva   |Frontend (general) | - Corrected some mistakes in the entry classes <br> - Wrote a wiki for all the classes implemented by me during W1 <br> - Created an initial version of the settings menu||
| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |-had small difficulties intalling some modules (solved now). <br>-finished my research on how to use the JSON file format and adapted this format to our use (on the base of Junyuan (Frank) Wang 's work).<br> - Implemented the save and load functions for the entry class.<br> - started to implement the saving and loading for the EntryPerso class too.|-Finsih to implement the saving and loading for the EntryPerso classes (this is a lot more complicated as some arguments are themselves classes and etc..).<br> -Implement the possibility to choose where to save the files|
| Junyuan (Frank) Wang |File processing    |- Decide to use json file to save the entry into local files. <br> - Implement saving fuction with encryption and loading function with decryption on the base of Thomas's work. <br>|- Implement select_n_entries function which select several entries from local disk.|
| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Organization of the analysis team <br>- Common work with the subteam to find new ways of studying the user's data that can give useful insights <br>- Added time-related functionalities in the Entry class (get info on the day of the week/distance between two days) <br>- Switched time representation in the Entry class to QDate, with retrocompatibility (old methods still work) <br>- Research about time series analysis to understand the change in a user's data over time (trend-cycle component vs seasonality component).|- Work on the implementation of the STL algorithm (the method is described in [this paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf))|
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Refactored most of mood-specific analysis functions (in the class MoodAnalysis) into DataAnalysis to avoid writing them over and over for other variables. To do so, I implemented a representation of the variables using an enum type to enable parametrization of the different variables in our methods, along with other methods that retrieve data specific to a variable using this parametrization.<br>- Implemented an algorithm to compute linear regression coefficients to help identify trends in the data to be analyzed.|- Figure out with the rest of the team on how exactly to use the algorithms implemented so far to analyze user-data and proceed accoringly. <br>- Testing what we have so far|
| Artem Mamichev       |Data analysis      | <br>-Implemented function which outputs items (e.g SCREEN_TIME, SLEEP) in descending order of influence on MOOD. <br>- Introduced and implemented SUGGESSTIONS, text with recommendations for user on how he can improve his mood. In case mood is lower than expected, it tells what aspects are the most important to keep his eye on. And in case of positive progress, what items have the most effect on his mood. |Next week with analysis team we plan to test how our algorithms work and based on that will see what to work on next|
